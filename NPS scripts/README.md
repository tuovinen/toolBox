<h1>NPS Scripts</h1>

A company needs to contact new customers and send Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey. For this purpose we need to gather customer details from order emails.

<b>mails2files.vba</b>
Takes all selected emails and saves them as text files with an order number as a filename.

<b>npsrobo.py</b>
Iterates over the text files created by mails2files.vba and fetches the needed information for easy handling in Excel etc.
